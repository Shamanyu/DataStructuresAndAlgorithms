I had booked a ticket from Delhi to Hyderabad for today, July 16 2015. The money has been deducted from my account, however I received a notification which said that my booking is 'on hold' and to not book another ticket. Presently, it says 'You have no bookings'. It is very important for me to go home today and I have tried contacting you on all your customer care numbers, none of which are of any use. I have decided to book another pair of tickets from makemytrip and order you to cancel the booking which apparently you are in 'the process of doing'. Stop wooing people with pointless offers if you can't live up to the promise. I expect the money to be refunded within a day.
Thank you for your time.
