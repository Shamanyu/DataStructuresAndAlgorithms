The coffee cup
I faintly heard the sound of Mr.Clock. I had barely 20 minutes before I would be taken to visit the inexplicable room. 	Ms.Singh is early today. It's been 4 years and it still pains every bit as much. Just a matter of 5 minutes though, every 24 hours. I am willing to put up with this, just for another chance to understand that room. I wish someday I would get the opportunity to go over there, and not just look at it across 10 metres and a glass window. I love this window sill, makes the pain disappear faster. Each of the eight recliners seems occupied today. Each of the faces, as usual, has the same look of inexplicable calm before a certain storm. Ms. Singh goes there once a week. I know this because she always informs me one day prior that I am off work the next day. She always has tears in her eyes when telling me this, and seems sadder than usual. I wish I could see what Ms. Singh does when she goes there. However, there's no one else in this home to place me at my vantage point. Oh, there's Ms.Singh's phone ringing. Probably, her boss. Why is she crying? Where are you going? Don't leave me alone. Bad day to leave me out, I can't bear the cold. Oh, there's Ms.Singh. She's hugging Mr.Singh, he is sleeping though. I remember him. I last saw him four years back. In fact, he was the one who gifted me to Ms.Singh. He was unusually happy that day. I remember him tripping from the balcony while holding me. I never saw him after that, until today.
